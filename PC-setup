# SSH Setup for GitHub on PowerShell (Windows)

## 1. Check for Existing SSH Keys

Before you add a new SSH key to your GitHub account, you should check whether you have any existing SSH keys. 

Open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path ~/.ssh/

If you see a file named id_rsa.pub, you already have an SSH key.
2. Generate a New SSH Key

If you don't already have an SSH key (or you want to create a new one), you can generate one by running:

powershell

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

Replace your_email@example.com with the email address you used to sign up for GitHub.

When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter to accept the default location.
3. Add the SSH Key to the ssh-agent

Ensure the ssh-agent is running:

powershell

Start-Service -Name ssh-agent

Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:

powershell

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

If you created your key with a different name, or if you're using a legacy key, the path to the key will be different.
4. Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account

Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:

powershell

Get-Content ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip

Go to the GitHub website, navigate to your account settings, click on "SSH and GPG keys," and click on "New SSH key." Paste your SSH key into the field and click "Add SSH key."
5. Test the SSH Key

To make sure everything is working, try to SSH to GitHub. You should see a message like "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated."

powershell

ssh -T git@github.com

6. Use SSH URLs for Git Repositories

Finally, when you're cloning Git repositories (like the course repository), use the SSH URL, which looks like git@github.com:username/repo.git.

bash
