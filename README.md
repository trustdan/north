# Welcome!
# subj: Rust with Rust

North Spark will be hosting coding class again! No experience necessary. 

Who: You!  You crazy rustaceans! ðŸ¦€

What: The Rust language (rust lang).

Where:  VIRTUALLY (change) but feel free to come by and chat with us, ask your questions, etc.  Slack or Github work great too. 


~~~ North Spark Defense Lab, 641 Alert Ave, Grand Forks AFB, ND 58205.


When: VIRTUALLY (change) but feel free to come by and chat with us, ask your questions, etc.  Slack or Github work great too.

Why?  It's the most popular programming language for years running.  It "just works" and is secure. A programming unicorn, Rust is both a systems-level and high-level language.  It is great for data science and it plays nice with Python (see "Polars"). 

How?  YOU!  Through "Rustlings," "Rust Koans," "Exercism," and similarly thoughtful teach-yourself methods. 

How else?  Teamwork, O'Reilly Learning, Digital U, Youtube, etc.

   \) /  o o  \ (/
     '_   u   _'
     \ '-----' /
```

It is dangerous to go alone, take this:

```
      /| ________________
O|===|* >________________>
      \|
```

"How small a thought it takes to fill a whole life"

```
                                           \  /
